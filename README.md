AniCore is a unified anime metadata API for mapping anime, episodes, and dub/sub availability across sources like AniList, Kitsu, and streaming providers.

## Proxy support

Provider HTTP calls can run through a proxy when the API or sync scripts are started with one of these environment variables:

```sh
ANICORE_PROXY_URL=http://host:port bun run sync
HTTPS_PROXY=http://host:port bun run sync
HTTP_PROXY=http://host:port bun run sync
```

`ANICORE_PROXY_URL` takes priority over the standard proxy variables. `NO_PROXY` is also honored for hostnames that should bypass the proxy.

For disposable public proxies, set:

```sh
ANICORE_USE_FREE_PROXY=1 bun run sync
```

That loads and rotates the free HTTP proxy list from ProxyScrape's raw text endpoint. Because public proxies are unreliable, AniCore tries multiple proxies for each request and falls back to a normal direct fetch if none of the attempted proxies work.

Proxy state is cached under `data/cache`:

- `proxies.txt` - the reusable proxy pool, hydrated from ProxyScrape when stale
- `working_proxies.txt` - proxies that successfully completed a request
- `dead_proxies.txt` - proxies that failed a request and should be skipped

The default free-proxy attempt limit is 25 per request. Override it with:

```sh
ANICORE_USE_FREE_PROXY=1 ANICORE_FREE_PROXY_MAX_ATTEMPTS=50 bun run sync
```

Public proxies should not be used for sensitive authenticated provider calls.
