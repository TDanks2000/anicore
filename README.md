AniCore is a unified anime metadata API for mapping anime, episodes, and dub/sub availability across sources like AniList, Kitsu, and streaming providers.

## Proxy support

Provider HTTP calls can run through a proxy when the API or sync scripts are started with one of these environment variables:

```sh
ANICORE_PROXY_URL=http://host:port bun run sync
HTTPS_PROXY=http://host:port bun run sync
HTTP_PROXY=http://host:port bun run sync
```

`ANICORE_PROXY_URL` takes priority over the standard proxy variables. `NO_PROXY` is also honored for hostnames that should bypass the proxy.

For disposable public proxies, set:

```sh
ANICORE_USE_FREE_PROXY=1 bun run sync
```

That loads and rotates the free HTTP proxy list from ProxyScrape's raw text endpoint. Public proxies are unreliable and should not be used for sensitive authenticated provider calls.
